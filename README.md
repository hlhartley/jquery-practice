# JQuery Practice
I created this project to practice JQuery. 

### Key:
- Presidents with a blue background were associated with the Democratic Party
- Presidents with a red background were associated with the Republican Party
- Presidents with a purple background and white text were 'Whig'
- Presidents with no background were associated with no party, the Federalist Party, the Democratic-Republic Party, or the National-Republican Party.
